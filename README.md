CAN WE ACCURATELY PREDICT PATIENTS  PRESCRIPTIONS USING BOTH TRADITIONAL PREDICTIVE MODELS AND  MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES?

One major difficulty in the UK pharmaceutical industry is the timely distribution of prescriptions, hence the need for demand forecasting. This project validates the applicability of advanced machine learning techniques, such as clustering algorithms like K-means, classification algorithms like Random Forest classification, recurrent neural networks (RNN) and an ensemble model combining Random Forest and Regression (RFR), in predicting patients' prescription. The research compares these methods with other more traditional forecasting techniques including trend projection using time series models such as ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA. Two data sets are used for our experiments: one obtained using the Monte Carlo Simulation and another, one year pseudonymised data from Lloyds pharmacy. Findings suggest that while random forest regressor and recurrent neural networks show better performance with lower rsme, regression models show better statistically significant forecasting accuracy.
